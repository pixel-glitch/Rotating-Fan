# Rotating-Fan

In this mini-project we have demonstrated the Rotation of Fan by using OpenGL and the model is designed with pure C++ code. OpenGL is a freely available Computer Graphics operating system. Here we use header files of, OpenGL is an interactive environment. When the program is executed the fan would be rotating at its normal speed and also a keyboard press event is added which leads to three options. The first option is for starting the fan then modifying the speed and the last option is to make it roptate in less speed.
The aim of this project is to design a 3D fan using OpenGL, where the speed of rotation of the fan can be controlled by the user. This demo displays the Rotation of the fan which is designed and implemented using the C++ program language and APIs provided by OpenGL. It has been developed to undergo user modifications. The user modification can be specification and movement with several other features. It is our first insight into the vast world of interactive graphics.
